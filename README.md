The prediction of stock prices has long been a challenging task in the field of finance and machine learning. This abstract presents a machine learning program designed to predict the stock prices of Apple Inc. using historical price data collected from the Yahoo Finance API. The program employs a specialized machine learning model known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network that has shown promise in capturing complex temporal dependencies in sequential data.

The dataset used for training and evaluation covers a period from January 1, 2016, to December 17, 2022, providing a comprehensive historical record of Apple's stock price movements. The Yahoo Finance API is utilized to gather this dataset, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. The dataset comprises features such as opening, closing, high, and low prices, as well as trading volume.

The LSTM model is selected for its ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns in sequential data. The model is designed to take a sequence of historical stock prices as input and predict the next-day closing price. This prediction allows for potential insights into future price trends.

The program encompasses various stages, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation. Data preprocessing involves scaling the input features and creating sequences that capture the temporal nature of the data. The LSTM model architecture consists of multiple layers of LSTM cells, followed by a fully connected layer for prediction. The model is trained using historical data and evaluated on a held-out validation set.

Performance metrics Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used to assess the accuracy of the predictions. The goal is to create a model that can effectively capture the stock price trends and fluctuations exhibited by Apple's stock over time.

The results of the program demonstrate the potential of LSTM models in predicting stock prices. The abstract concludes by discussing the implications of accurate stock price predictions for investors, traders, and financial analysts. It also highlights areas for further research and improvement in the field of financial time series prediction using machine learning techniques.
